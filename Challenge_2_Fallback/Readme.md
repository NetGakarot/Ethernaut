# Ethernaut Level 1: Fallback

## ðŸ”§ Challenge Summary:
The contract has a fallback function that can transfer ownership if certain conditions are met.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Become the owner of the contract and withdraw the balance.

---

## âœ… Solution Strategy:

1. Call `contribute()` with a small amount of ETH.  
   â†’ This adds your address to the `balances` mapping.

2. Send ETH directly to the contract (not via any function).  
   â†’ This triggers the `receive()` function (fallback), which checks if `msg.value > 0` and youâ€™re in `balances`.

3. If both conditions are true, the fallback sets you as the **owner**.

4. Now call `withdraw()` to drain the contract balance.

## ðŸ§ª Testing:
All steps have been automated using a Foundry test script inside `foundryTest/Fallback.t.sol`.

Run the tests:
